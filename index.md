Step by step, the path unfolds, <br>
A winding tale yet to be told.<br>
The peak ahead, a distant sight,<br>
Yet each small step must guide the light.<br>

One foot wrong, a moment lost,<br>
A lesson learned, a heavy cost.<br>
Be mindful, steady, strong, aware,<br>
The road is real, so tread with care.<br>

Not just the peak, but all between,<br>
The breath, the pause, the hills unseen.<br>
The laughter, trials, sights so grand,<br>
The journey holds the heart in hand.<br>

A guide may point which way to go,<br>
But only you can truly know.<br>
For mentors shine, but they must see,<br>
Your goal is yours, your destiny.<br>

To help another on their way,<br>
Can brighten even darker days.<br>
Alone is fast, but far needs two,<br>
Together strong, together true.<br>

A walking stick, a steady guide,<br>
A set of truths to stand beside.<br>
It tests the ground, it keeps you sure,<br>
A firm belief helps all endure.<br>

Some paths are smooth, some filled with stone,<br>
Some lead you far, some lead you home.<br>
Yet when you stand atop the climb,<br>
Regret should never cloud the time.<br>

Sustenance, the fuel of might,<br>
To quench the thirst, to feed the fight.<br>
Breaks refresh, they bring new pace,<br>
Not slowing down, but strength’s embrace.<br>

Life’s not a line, it bends and sways,<br>
Through rising peaks and lowly days.<br>
Observe, adapt, don’t rush ahead,<br>
Each winding turn is wisely tread.<br>

And luck, like storms or skies so clear,<br>
May shape the course, yet persevere.<br>
For when it pours, dig deep, push through,<br>
If fate is kind, then walk on true.<br>

Some ride the winds, some climb alone,<br>
Some find a path through means unknown.<br>
But wealth or speed won't break the mold,<br>
True effort carves the steps in gold.<br>

So onward, onward, take the stride,<br>
With wisdom walking at your side.<br>
No matter where your feet must roam,<br>
The path you choose will lead you home.<br>
